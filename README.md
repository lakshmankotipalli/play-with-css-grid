    >> Defining a basic Grid
        ** You can define a Grid by assigning display property grid.
        ex: display: grid.
        ** display: grid defines a block level grid that takes the width of the parent container
        ** display: inline-grid defines an inline grid.
        ** We write markup for Columns and Rows inside the parent Grid container.
    >> Columns and Rows
        ** The Columns and Rows in CSS Grid are created by using the properties "grid-template-columns" and "grid-template-rows".
        ** These properties take same type and structure of values for defining the width and track size of columns and rows.
        ** You can use different units like Pixels(px), Percentage(%), Fraction(fr) for sizing.
        ** repeat() function, fit-content() function
        ** grid-column-start, grid-column-end
        ** grid-template-areas and grid-area
